VPN vs Tor: 
VPN company will most likely know what websites you are visiting further even if they don't collect that info other info that may potentially identify you are collected and it is required by indian govt that vpn companies collect that data.  
Your ISP(internet service provider) will know that you are using Tor but they won't know what you are using it for so Tor is safer than vpns in this regard as important info doesn't go into the hands of others.
