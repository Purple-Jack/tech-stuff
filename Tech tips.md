1. To avoid spam and/or to create a temporary account to get something use 10 minute email websites

2. You can download a webpage as a pdf 
   just click print or ctrl p then you will find an option to save as pdf under printer list

3. If you want a certain section from a huge pdf 
   say I want Annihilation of caste from BASW vol 1 
   then I click print then save as pdf but the pages I set them manually matching the page numbers of AOC.

4. best way to convert epub to pdf:
   epub is an ebook format used for reading ebooks on phones. They can also be used on PC. Readers can tweak fonts, their sizes and basically control many aspects and display the book according to their preference epubs are also generally smaller in size compared to pdf however pdf is more commonly used and is more familiar with many people. 
   Most online and offline conversion software do a terrible job the best way I found is to use Calibre and first convert the epub into a word document (.docx) or (.odt open document) then make any changes you need if at all there are any and then export that odt or docx as a pdf. It does wonders.

7. This should be obvious still. Avoid giving your e-mail and/or phone number to some websites. You might want to see what is written on the website however they will spam you. They will also give your data to others, and your message and email inbox will be filled with advertisements. Sometimes you might also get ad calls. Sometimes some important emails go to spam and if your spam is also filled then you may have a hard time dealing with emails. 
   Use services like 10 minute mail and try to find an alternative way and only give your details when it is necessary, not to some unimportant website.
