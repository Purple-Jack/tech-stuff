# Virtualization

To try out different operating systems without affecting your hard drive use **virtualization** ! [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "https://www.virtualbox.org/") `foss` if you come across any problem like reading a usb inside a VM or trouble going full screen just look it up online there are detailed instructions
VMs are generally slower than running the operating system directly on hard disk. Also they are affected by the processor and RAM you have the higher the better. Also depending on what you want to do with your VM allocate memory accordingly if you want to install a number of apps that are more than 'few' then increase size.
If your system has ram lower than 8GB better stay away [Virtual Machine Requirements](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/communications/session-border-controller/8.3.0/releasenotes/rn-virtual-machine-requiremments-830.html "https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/communications/session-border-controller/8.3.0/releasenotes/rn-virtual-machine-requiremments-830.html") however you can simple install linux on older system to revive them like https://www.partitionwizard.com/clone-disk/lightweight-linux-distro.html , puppy linux etc. see linux https://github.com/Purple-Jack/tech-stuff/blob/main/Linux.md#linux
