# Really Simple Syndication(RSS) feeds

This is an **RSS reader** (RSS: Really Simple Syndication)
you gotta go to a website and find out its rss link then put it in this app (click gear icon)
then click 'load full content' 
boom! you will get to read all the articles rather than painstakingly circumventing firewalls for each individual article
easily bypass news site paywalls and assemble all your news in one place(^◡^ ) [Releases · yang991178/fluent-reader · GitHub](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader/releases "https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader/releases") `foss` 

Some websites will only give a limited view of articles or just the title. Fluent reader gets most of the article but fluent reader will lag if you add a lot of feeds if you don't have the memory and processing capacity so you have to use another feed reader instead in that case use this. 

This will give you a new link that fetches the entire article. [https://morss.it/](https://morss.it/ "https://morss.it/")
