# To change icons of files:

.ico are icon files .exe also works (pngs are not so don't download them from webites thinking you can use them) [https://www.iconfinder.com/](https://www.iconfinder.com/ "https://www.iconfinder.com/") [https://icon-icons.com/](https://icon-icons.com/ "https://icon-icons.com/") download .ico files from here or other sites that get a green signal from virus total. [Types](https://ystr.github.io/types/ "https://ystr.github.io/types/") this is a FOSS app but virus total flagged this as potentially malicious so the other alternative is a non foss app- File Types Manager for Windows which received a green signal. 
File Types Manager `freeware | closed-source` [FileTypesMan - Alternative to 'File Types' manager of Windows](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html "https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html") (scroll down to download) 
run the exe file
find the file type you are looking for 
right click 
edit selected file type 
click on the three dots next to default icon bar to browse for icons 
select the .ico file

you can try converting png to ico but the result doesn't turn out great.
