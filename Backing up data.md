# Backing up data

**Why you must have a backup of your data?** 

We never know what will happen to our devices so it is better to be safe than sorry and create a backup of all important files. You may have noticed that sometimes when you try to do something in your device you are prompted to create a backup that is because during the process there is a possibility that you may lose your files. There is the threat of malware corrupting files or even your hard disk physically getting damaged. So rather than ending up in a situation where you won't be able to recover your device it is much better to have a backup.
