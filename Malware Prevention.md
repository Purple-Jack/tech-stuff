# Malware Prevention

**Check files for viruses using Virus Total** **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ "https://www.virustotal.com/gui/")**

Most of the times it is us who open doors to malware. If we visit some websites and popups appear and we click them ironically, some malicious pop ups disguise themselves as anti-virus software as "your computer has xyz download this to bla bla". It is us who grant permissions to apps that we download .exe files won't run in windows 10 unless we grant permission. Some times (only sometimes) windows defender(window's native anti virus that scans for virus) shows false positives(false positives are instances where an anti virus app thinks a process is malicious). Some apps either bring up the blue box which win recommends not to install or the orange stripe on the box that confirms whether you want to install something. If blue box appears think twice before installing preferably don't install it.
Always download apps from sources mentioned in their official website(important). 
While installing them click advanced to see which path they are being installed ( you can change it to D drive rather than putting everything in C or customize it to your needs) also you can find out whether the app is bundleware they aren't necessarily malicious but they install apps more than you asked for without your permission. In your Browser settings set download path to custom and to ask you everytime you download a file so you have more control on what is being downloaded and don't end up downloading something you didn't want this coupled with having file extensions enabled will prevent you from accidentally clicking and running a malicous file.
Use a good adblocker in browser like u block origin. Make your browser ask you where to save each file before downloading every time it tries to download something so you have more control over what is being downloaded. There is a possibility that you click a link and that downloads a file without your knowledge and you then later install it thinking its a legit app. 
Use virus total to check whether something is legit or not. 
Prefer https everywhere because websites that use http have a potential to leak data that you are entering on the website as http is not as safe as https. The data you enter must only be between you and the website and http doesn't do this. 
Don't run random apps. Pirating is a huge risk. One can easily be susceptible to malware if they are a pirate. Use a FOSS alternative instead unless you know what you are doing.
